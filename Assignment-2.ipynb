    "like this: False.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use these Boolean values in conditional statements, loops, and other parts of your Python code to make decisions \n",

    "2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-->\n",
    "There are three main types of Boolean operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. AND Operator (and): The AND operator returns `True` if both operands are `True`. \n",
    "    If at least one operand is `False`, it returns `False`. In Python, the AND operator is represented by the keyword `and`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   True and True  # Returns True\n",
    "   True and False  # Returns False\n",
    "   False and True  # Returns False\n",
    "   False and False  # Returns False\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. OR Operator (or): The OR operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`. \n",
    "    It returns `False` only if both operands are `False`. In Python, the OR operator is represented by the keyword `or`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   True or True  # Returns True\n",
    "   True or False  # Returns True\n",
    "   False or True  # Returns True\n",
    "   False or False  # Returns False\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. NOT Operator (not): The NOT operator is a unary operator that negates the value of its operand. \n",
    "    It returns `True` if the operand is `False`, and it returns `False` if the operand is `True`. \n",
    "    In Python, the NOT operator is represented by the keyword `not`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   not True  # Returns False\n",
    "   not False  # Returns True\n",
